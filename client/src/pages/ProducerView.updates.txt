We need to make the following changes:

1. Find all ScrollArea components in the chat areas and change their style from:
```jsx
style={{ 
  minHeight: "300px",
  height: anyCallActive ? "auto" : "calc(96vh - 350px)",
  maxHeight: anyCallActive ? "none" : "calc(96vh - 350px)",
  transition: "all 0.3s ease"
}}
```

To:
```jsx
style={{ 
  height: "calc(96vh - 350px)",
  transition: "all 0.3s ease"
}}
```

2. These changes should be applied to all three ScrollArea components used for chat containers (Studio A, Studio B, and RE Studio).

3. We've verified that the call line containers already have the correct style in place:
```jsx
style={{ 
  height: "calc(96vh - 350px)", 
  transition: "all 0.3s ease"
}}
```

Let's make these changes in the ProducerView.tsx file at line numbers approx. 999, 1105, and 1386.
